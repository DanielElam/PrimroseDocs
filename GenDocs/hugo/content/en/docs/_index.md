Welcome to the Primrose user guide. This site provides technical documentation and guidance for using the Primrose game engine.

## What is Primrose?

Primrose is a 3D game engine born out of the desire for a standalone alternative to ROBLOX Studio. It provides a similar API and workflow with additional features such as physically-based rendering, modern graphical effects, heightmap terrain, skinning, advanced asset management and Steamworks integration.

## Is Primrose for me?

If you are experienced with ROBLOX Studio and are looking for a standalone alternative for publishing to game stores like Steam, you might be interested in Primrose.
