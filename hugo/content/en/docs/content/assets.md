An asset is a piece of content which is stored in the game files. They can be textures, models, sounds, levels, et cetera.

They are similar to assets on ROBLOX, but instead of uploading them through a website you import them through the Pipeline processing tool. This can be done through the **Pipeline CLI** or the **Content Browser** in PrimEd. 

Assets are usually referenced by `ContentId` properties on instances.
